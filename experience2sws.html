   <p class="h1">Counselling made me Mentally strong and Self-dependent Emotionally</p>
   Today I am sharing my experience of counseling. I can feel that I have become mentally strong
    and self-dependent emotionally; the major credit goes to counseling!

   <p class="h1">Acceptance is more Important than Perfection</p>
   Towards the end of my PhD journey, when I ran out of energy, I was left with probably the last
   leg of the PhD- a few experiments and then thewriting up. The experiments were done in a month, 
   but the paper writing seemed like never ending. It started to stress me out and I became veryanxious
   as to when it will finish.

   <p class="h1">I thought only success meant happiness but I was wrong.</p>
   I am a 4th yr B.Tech and living outside the IIIT Kota campus. Initially, when I started my journey, 
   I had trouble adapting to life in College.After admission ,I felt, I couldn't focus on either. So, I
    decided to take the help of the counselor at the campus. I came to know about Mr Tapan Jain and began seeing him 
    regarding my troubles. From the first day itself, I knew I was in the company of someone who understood me. He 
    made me feel comfortable.

   time Regarding my placement because the fear of not getting good marks in 7th Sem,.Then I met to counselor Mr.Parikshit . He 
   showed me the right path. And , Now I am happily working in Amazon.
