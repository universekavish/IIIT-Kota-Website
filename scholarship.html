        Familiarize yourself with requirements and apply. It is individual studentâ€™s responsibility to apply and keep track of end dates.
        <br><br>
        You may contact IIITK office for bonafide certificate (of your enrollment and stay) and fee structure if required.
        <br><br>
        We are in the process of adding IIITK as institute in the databases of Social Justice and Welfare department of respective states, due to required paperwork and process this may take some time. Update:- We have sent documents to UP Samaj Kalyan Vibhag for the same.
        <br><br>
        Note:-
        <br><br>
        1. Student must not avail more than one scholarship at the same time.
        <br><br>
        2. Student must inform IIITK office after you receive scholarship so that this information can be provided when asked by the agency for follow up.
