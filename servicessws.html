            <p>Appointments are available from 10.30 am to 5.30 pm Monday-Friday and students are usually seen for 45 minutes,
               depending on demand.  Student can take appointment by mailing us on: <a href="office@iiitkota.ac.in">office@iiitkota.ac.in</a>
               <br><br>
                Intake appointments are scheduled with students at times and dates which are convenient to them, 
                depending on their academic commitments.
                <br><br>
                In either case, the goal of the first meeting is to help the student identify the issues that 
                are causing them the most concern.
                <br><br>
                If a student wishes to continue in counselling, he/she usually continues to meet with the same 
                counsellor seen in intake or Walk-In.

          <li>Psychological Assessment
            <p>
                In some cases where more precise diagnoses are required, we conduct psychological assessments.
                These tests are administered by a trained psychometrician. These tests help all those who are 
                concerned with the student’s wellbeing to decide upon the best possible intervention.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Workshops and Events
            <p>
                The Wellness centre also organizes different workshops and events during each academic year. 
                The workshops and events are organized on different topics related to mental health and are 
                based on the need of the students like dealing with stress, time management, relationship issues etc.
                <br><br>
                At the beginning of each academic year we have workshops for the 1st year students, 
                like orientation . We also have a training program for mentors 
                where effective mentoring skills are demonstrated and sharpened; updates of which can be 
                seen on www.facebook.com/icareiitb.
                <br><br>
                The team organizes various events on occasions like Mental Health Day, 
                International Happiness Day and World Suicide Prevention Day.
