   <p class="h1">Life Changing Experience</p>
   When I came for the first meeting with my counsellor Miss Pooja...I had a tons of questions inside me..
   .I was feeling weird too that I am mentally unstable that I have to meet her.." a counsellor"...though
    it was my decision only...but gradually all my doubts, questions were patiently answered. My anger and
     aggression. which was my primary concern has been significantly reduced. Moreover, I have inculcated
      many good habits like reading books. writing poems etc. Every week she used to give me good books to 
      read and later we discuss on it. To summarize..I had a life changing experience with her. Though a token
       of thanks is extremely small to express my gratitude towards her..still ..thank you..and thanks to IIIT 
       too for providing such an excellent space and counsellors with whom we can share and get benefited..
        thanks once again.

   <p class="h1">I started Healing the moment I felt Heard</p>
   I am a B.Tech Final student . I had just finished the first semester in IIIT and I had been feeling too low and
    depressed because I had never been through such an amount of stress. I developed severe anxiety. 
    Initially it was low but then it  I became suicidal and only thing which was coming to my mind was 
    run away. I was clueless and couldn't identify what the problem was where I was stuck. Friends tried 
    to help but they couldn't understand and I found there was no solution. Then I remembered about Student 
    Counselling/Wellness centre and just went thinking that if nothing is working I should give this atleast 
    a try. But then when I started sessions with councellor there I felt much more relieved. I had someone to
     talk to someone to understand and suggest solutions. Slowly and gradually following their advice I became
      better. I dont have those depressive feelings and anxiety of that level now. Thanks to Student Wellness
       Centre. I would suggest if anyone is stuck and clueless with what's happening with them they should 
       atleast give this a try. It really helps.

   <p class="h1">Right Intervention at the Right Time</p>
   I am a new student in IIIT Kota Bombay and in the beginning of semester due to so much pressure 
   I was totally lost and was not able to understand any thing that was happening to me. I was in great
    trouble personally. Then I decided to talk to student wellness center in campus  and the counselor 
    treated me so well and really CAUGHT THE POINT that what is missing in my efforts. She gave me the right
      advise  and with in  a week I was in my best  mental shape and now I am going on with my work. The talk
       was so beneficial that I can say that now I am the doctor of myself as I am able to identify where my 
       issues are coming from and deal with with them.
