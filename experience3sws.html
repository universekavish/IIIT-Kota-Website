   <p class="h1">A friend and a shoulder to rely on</p>
   I was suffering from a personal problem since a long time. As the day passed it was getting tougher 
   for me to overcome my problem despite taking help from the friends. It was then I decided to take help 
   the consultant. Initially I was too hesitant to take the help as I thought consulting is only for the 
   losers and people who are mentally challenged and me being an IIT-ian, it will be against my pride to 
   take help of some consultant, but I had no other option left and thought letâ€™s give this a try. To my 
   surprise, it was an overall good experience for me. It helped me a lot.

   <p class="h1">Changed perspective</p>
   I went into depression and anxiety disorder just before coming to IIIT Kota. When I reached IIIT, I was 
   not able to concentrate on my studies. Not only on studies but each and everything in my life. After a few 
   months I came to know about the student counsellors in IIIT Kota through my Professor. The Professor arranged a
    meeting with Mrs. Hima Anaredy, a student counselor of IIIT Kota. Initially I was hesitant to meet a stranger 
    and tell him/her that I need help. But then I had already reached a stage where I wanted to vent out my emotions 
    which I was not able to handle by myself.
