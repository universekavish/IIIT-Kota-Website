   <p class="h1">
      After securing admission at the Institute and starting your stay here, 
      you may feel that a lot of parameters around you are different.  
      You would have more responsibilities to handle at the hostel and at the academic level. 
      Take heart, you will not be the only one. There are a few issues that almost everyone in 
      the Institute faces initially like academic concerns, social (family and peer) pressure etc, 
      leading to feelings of loneliness, low confidence, anxiety, stress, anger and sadness, to name a few.
      <br><br>
      It is important to understand that students often lose their focus and give in to these pressures. 
      If not attended to at the right time, this could lead to poor performance -- both academically and personally.
      <br><br>
      To help you refrain from losing focus and being unhappy, we as Counsellors encourage you to 
      approach us for any problem that you are facing-  be it academic, emotional, social or financial- without hesitation.
      <br><br>
      Counselling provides an opportunity for individuals to learn to make better choices, 
      improve interpersonal skills, develop confidence and increase educational effectiveness. 
      In a one-on-one meeting with a counsellor, students are helped to explore and express feelings, 
      examine beliefs and ways of thinking about their present situation, reflect on patterns of behavior, 
      and work toward making healthier and happier changes.
      <br><br>
      
 
  <ul class="h3">
